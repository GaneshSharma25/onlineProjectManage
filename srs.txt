1. User Management:
   - User registration and authentication: Users should be able to create accounts and log in securely to access the system.
   - User roles and permissions management: Differentiate between user roles (e.g., project managers, team members, administrators) and assign appropriate permissions to control access to features and data.
   - User profile management: Allow users to update their profiles, including personal information, profile pictures, and contact details.

2. Project Creation and Management:
   - Create new projects and assign project details: Users should be able to create projects and provide essential information such as project title, description, start and end dates, and associated stakeholders.
   - Assign project managers and team members: Designate project managers responsible for overseeing project activities and assign team members to collaborate on tasks.
   - Track project progress and status: Provide a dashboard or overview page to monitor the overall progress and status of each project, including key milestones, task completion, and project timeline.
   - Add, update, and delete project tasks: Enable the creation, modification, and deletion of tasks within a project to define the work breakdown structure.
   - Set task dependencies and milestones: Allow users to establish task dependencies and define milestones to track progress and ensure sequential execution of tasks.
   - Generate reports on project status and progress: Generate project-specific reports, such as task completion rates, resource utilization, and project timeline, to assist in monitoring and decision-making.

3. Task Management:
   - Create, update, and delete tasks within a project: Enable the creation, modification, and removal of individual tasks, including task details (title, description, due dates, etc.).
   - Assign tasks to team members: Assign tasks to specific team members responsible for their completion.
   - Track task status, priority, and deadlines: Track the status of each task (e.g., not started, in progress, completed), set task priorities, and establish deadlines for timely completion.
   - Set task dependencies and milestones: Specify dependencies between tasks to ensure proper task sequencing and identify critical path activities. Define milestones to mark significant achievements within the project.
   - Assign task resources and estimated effort: Allocate resources (e.g., team members, equipment) to tasks and estimate the effort required for task completion.
   - Allow task comments and discussions: Facilitate collaboration by enabling task-specific discussions and comments among team members.


4. Time Tracking and Reporting:
   - Allow team members to track time spent on tasks: Enable team members to log and track the time they spend on individual tasks to monitor progress and evaluate productivity.
   - Generate reports on task and project-level time tracking: Generate reports summarizing the time spent on tasks or at the project level. These reports can provide insights into resource allocation, identify bottlenecks, and aid in project planning.
   - Provide insights into resource utilization and workload distribution: Analyze resource allocation and workload distribution across tasks and projects to ensure optimal resource utilization and balanced work assignments.

6. Document Management:
   - Store and manage project-related documents and files
